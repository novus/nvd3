If one of [the existing models](https://github.com/novus/nvd3/tree/master/src/models) doesn't meet your needs, fork the project, implement the model and an example using it, send us a pull request, for consideration for inclusion in the project.

Please do not aggregate pull requests. Aggregated pull requests are actually more difficult to review!

We are currently changing our branch structure so that master will be gauranteed stable. In addition, there is now a "development" branch. This branch reflects the latest changes to nvd3 and is not necessarily stable.

Minifying your fork:

The Makefile requires [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).

The easiest way to install is to install via npm. Run `npm install
uglify-js` from your home directory, then add the output from `npm bin`
into your path so that you have access to `uglifyjs` from the command
line (remember to restart your terminal window when adding to the path.)

Once you have `uglifyjs` command available, running `make` from your
fork's root directory will rebuild both `nv.d3.js` and `nv.d3.min.js`.

Without UglifyJS, you won't get the minified version when running make.

**We ask that you DO NOT minify pull requests... 
If you need to minify please build pull request in separate branch, and
merge and minify in your master.
